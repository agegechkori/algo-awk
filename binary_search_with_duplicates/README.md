## Binary search with duplicates

Implement binary search in an array `A` with possible duplicates. Return the index of the last occurrence of the element in question. Return `-insertion point` if the element is not present in the array. The `insertion point` is defined as the point at which the key would be inserted into the array: the index of the first element greater than the key, or `A.length + 1` if all elements in the array are less than the specified key.

# Algorithms in Awk

The goal of this project is, first and foremost, to have fun implementing algorithms in [Awk](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html)<sup>1</sup> - a programming language designed for text processing. Awk is not typically associated with complex algorithms, but is often a great tool for some tasks of that nature due to its expressive syntax. So let's see how far we can take it.

<sup>1</sup>All the code is tested and works with the GNU Awk. It should in theory work with all the other Awk flavors, but it is not guaranteed.
